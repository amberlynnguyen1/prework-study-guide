# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to help prepare for the upcoming bootcamp. It helped me learn and answered basic questions about different topics, such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Additionally, this Prework Study Guide was created to contain helpful notes on those four topics that I will be able to reference during the bootcamp.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide is helpful because it has various uses. There are notes on each topic: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. In addition to having access to the notes we wrote in the study guide, we can use this Prework Study Guide as a reference of beginner topics and look at the code we used to create the study guide. With the study guide, we are also able to open the DevTools console, where we can see the JavaScript running. We are able to see the list of topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
